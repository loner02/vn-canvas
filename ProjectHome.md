## Description ##

A visual novel engine for HTML5 Canvas,
designed for non-programmers so developers can concentrate on gameplay and story telling.

Though targeted for visual novels, with a little imagination, it's good enough to make
```
- non-flash ads
- image slideshows
- online powerpoint-like presentations
- visual learning tool for kids
- and much more
```

## Release Notes ##

**New** Release 0.5.1a is a minor update that includes **vn-Canvas Syntax Builder**, available at at [Sourceforge](http://goo.gl/pDgGEz) and [Google drive](http://goo.gl/8H3C2F).

Note: For those who already have v.0.5.1, there are minimal engine updates. So if you do not require the syntax builder, no need to get 0.5.1a.

**Update** Release 0.5.1 at [Sourceforge](http://goo.gl/pDgGEz) and [Google drive](http://goo.gl/8H3C2F). Includes support for responsive grid and workaround for FF HTML5 audio.

Release 0.5.0 at [Sourceforge](http://goo.gl/pDgGEz) and [Google drive](http://goo.gl/W46AD3).

**Update** HTML5 Audio seems broken in the latest Firefox 34.0 (works in older versions though, 33.1.1). Currently trying to work out a solution.

Release 0.4.2 at [Sourceforge](http://goo.gl/DLp3SE) and [Google drive](http://goo.gl/9DnGHG).

**Update** Preliminary support for autotype in script box at release [r101](https://code.google.com/p/vn-canvas/source/detail?r=101)/[r102](https://code.google.com/p/vn-canvas/source/detail?r=102).

**Update** vn-canvas is now also available at Sourceforge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/vn-canvas/)

Due to change in Google download policy (http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html), all new downloads will soon be hosted at Sourceforge.

Release 0.4.1 is now available for download. Includes support for actor sprite and avatar animation.

Note: I'm a bit busy with my day job, so updates and/or support may not be as frequent as before. If you have request or even patches/contributions you'd like to be added to the engine, just drop me a line. Thanks!

Oh, if you want to join the project, I'm accepting contributors. :)

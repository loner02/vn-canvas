=WELCOME TO vn-canvas=

A visual novel engine for HTML5 Canvas, designed for non-programmers so developers can concentrate on gameplay and story telling.

Though targeted for visual novels, with a little imagination, it's good enough to make

  * non-flash ads
  * image slideshows
  * online powerpoint-like presentations
  * visual learning tool for kids

Best of all, it's built using free tools at zero budget!

= FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING VN-CANVAS =

==What's a Visual Novel?==
 It's a less-popular game genre (compared to MMORPGs, RTS, FPS, etc.), mostly used in dating sims. But it's more than that. Think Choose-Your-Own-Adventure meets graphic novels.

==Why make another engine?==
 Actually, this just started as a study in HTML5 that has gone a little too way out of hand. :) Admittedly, there's a lot of better engines out there.

==How do I play a Visual Novel?==
 Normally, it's just read, click on the choices and continue. VNs usually have little or no gameplay. Unless you add minigames, but VN players are not usually arcade players.

 For vn-canvas, however, I borrowed some features from VN's distant cousin RPG, such as map and tile navigation. This is a less direct way of asking the question "Where do you want to go?", and gives the player some "exploration" capabilities for non-linear play.

==Can I sell something I make with it?==
 I'm no expert in licenses but I think so. What I'm providing you is a free pen and paper to write your novel, but the novel is entirely yours to do whatever you want with it.

==Can I help?==
 Sure why not. I appreciate feature requests, bug reports, patches, etc. Also, I do not have access to other platforms, particularly IE9/Win7, Safari/MAC, iOs, Android, iPhone, etc. So any help on the above is very much welcome.

==If I make something with it, do you require anything in return?==
 Nope. Nada. Even credit or link back is totally optional. I'd like to see what you did though. I'm not asking for a copy of your work, just maybe a link to your site or a couple of screenshots, just for my "bragging rights". :)

==What are those different downloads and different versions (vncanvas-0.x.js)?==
 Those are just versions I keep for history and tracking. Sometimes, some code may get broken because of updates and it is usually useful to have some working code to revert back to.

 If you only need the latest, just get the highest numbered download or the highest versioned javascript. Note however that the build version at SVN may be newer than the packaged download versions.

==Why are the versions named after girl's names?==
 That's just a fancy way of calling Alpha, Beta, etc. versions. Might as well stick with it. :)

==It doesn't work on my device. Why?==
 HTML5 is platform and browser dependent. Some implement HTML5 features differently from the other, if they implement it at all. There is no "one size fits all". Cross platform doesn't exactly mean it'll work the same way on different platforms.

  Tip#1: If you want to target multiple devices that are totally different from one another, it may be better to have multiple packages.

  Tip#2: If you want to target a family of similar devices, try developing for the lower-end devices. Chances are, it'll work on the higher end devices.  

==Is the engine safe to use?==
 The engine requires running javascript on the end-user's local platform. Though I guarantee that the base engine is free of any malware (and I invite anyone to inspect the source), I can not guarantee that someone with malicious intent will/can not insert harmful code on a "game" they'll distribute. Therefore I leave it up to the end-user to have sufficient malware security protection, just as they would have when visiting any javascript-enabled site.

==What is that *"RPG mod pack"* thing?==
 It's an optional addon that transforms the engine to a lite-RPG engine. It doesn't change the base engine per se, but uses it to implement RPG-like functions. Don't worry, if you're a VN purist, just don't include the mod pack and all is well.

==You say it is for non-programmers, but I still see a lot of codes in there?==
 Ok, you can use the engine without doing any javascript-ing. What you get is a basic but working engine. None of the fancy stuff. If you want a bit of customization, you may have to do a little coding here and there. Now if you want your game to be really awesome, then dive in there and get your hands dirty with programming.

 Technically though, when you create your script, even if you're just following the basics, you're already programming. You just don't know it yet. :)
